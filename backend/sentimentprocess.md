ðŸ“Š MacroMind MVP AI Feature Implementation Guide

This file contains the critical AI and data processing tasks for the MacroMind MVP, based on the planning documents (Sentiment Process.pdf and Volatility Estimation.pdf).

ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analysis Expansion (MVP Scope)

ðŸ”¹ Goal

Enhance the Sentiment Analysis Pipeline to:
	â€¢	Aggregate sentiment scores across News and Reddit.
	â€¢	Dynamically adjust benchmarks based on market conditions.
	â€¢	Collect basic sector-level fundamentals.
	â€¢	Support multi-timeframe sentiment analysis (design only).

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Required Features

1. Dynamic Benchmark Selection
	â€¢	Choose SPY, QQQ, or RSP as the benchmark dynamically.
	â€¢	Selection based on overall market conditions (e.g., volatility indicators).
	â€¢	If market is very volatile, use RSP; otherwise default to SPY.

2. Sentiment Aggregation Pipeline
	â€¢	Calculate the following for each day:
	â€¢	Average daily sentiment score across Reddit and News.
	â€¢	7-day moving average sentiment score.
	â€¢	Separate tracking of Reddit sentiment and News sentiment.
	â€¢	Normalize sentiment scores on a 0-1 or -1 to 1 scale.

3. Sector Fundamentals Collection
	â€¢	For major sectors (e.g., Tech, Healthcare, Financials):
	â€¢	P/E Ratio
	â€¢	P/B Ratio
	â€¢	Earnings Growth Rate
	â€¢	Fetch using APIs:
	â€¢	AlphaVantage API (or Finnhub if needed).
	â€¢	Link each sectorâ€™s fundamentals to the overall sentiment database.

4. Multi-Timeframe Sentiment Framework
	â€¢	Build structure to support analyzing sentiment over different horizons:
	â€¢	Short-term: 1-5 days
	â€¢	Medium-term: 5-30 days
	â€¢	Long-term: 30+ days
	â€¢	No need to fully implement timeframe logic yet â€” only modularize the code for future expansion.

ðŸ“Š Volatility Prediction Model (MVP Scope)

ðŸ”¹ Goal

Implement a basic AI model for volatility estimation:
	â€¢	Forecast upcoming volatility for major indices based on past price movements and sentiment.

ðŸ”¹ Required Features

1. Simple Volatility Estimation
	â€¢	Use a model like Prophet or XGBoost to:
	â€¢	Predict future realized volatility based on past historical volatility.
	â€¢	Integrate aggregated sentiment score as an additional feature.

2. Basic Market Indicators
	â€¢	Fetch market indicators needed for volatility model:
	â€¢	Past historical prices (daily close)
	â€¢	Basic VIX data if available (optional for MVP)

3. Beta Prediction (Defer)
	â€¢	Do NOT implement dynamic beta prediction yet.
	â€¢	Save beta prediction for post-MVP Phase 2.

ðŸ“Š Infrastructure & Backend Requirements
	â€¢	Extend sentiment_pipeline.py to support new aggregation logic.
	â€¢	Add sector_fundamentals.py to fetch and store sector P/E, P/B, earnings growth.
	â€¢	Modify database schema if necessary:
	â€¢	Add fields for sector fundamentals.
	â€¢	Add fields for multi-source sentiment.
	â€¢	Create a new service volatility_model.py for volatility forecasting.
	â€¢	Extend FastAPI routes to serve new sentiment aggregates and volatility forecasts.

ðŸ“ˆ Notes for GitHub Copilot
	â€¢	Prioritize implementing MVP features clearly.
	â€¢	Use clean modular structure (separate data fetchers, processors, API routes).
	â€¢	Document all major classes and functions with Python docstrings.
	â€¢	Keep volatility and sentiment models in independent modules.
	â€¢	Database models should evolve with minimal migrations if possible.
